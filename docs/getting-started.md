# Getting Started

ServerCore is not designed to be the entry point for your project. It mainly focuses on functionality that aren't tied to user-facing elements. 

## Installation
ServerCore can be obtained from the [ServerCore repository](https://github.com/TeamEDMO/ServerCore). Once downloaded, it can be referenced from within your library/program.

## Usage
Refer to the left panel for individual guides.
