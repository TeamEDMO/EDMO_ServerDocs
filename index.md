# Welcome to the EDMO Server project documentation

This website aims to document the basics on how ServerCore works, and how you can build atop its foundations.

It also contains documentation about the API provided by the library


### What this website does not attempt to provide
* Implementation details regarding the frontend used by the EDMO study sessions
    + It is the expectation that every project should have an interface tailor made for the use case, as most projects are domain specific, and may not serve the same purpose.
* Documentation on ServerCore unit tests
